                    <h4>Gravity in the Galactic Center</h4>
										<p> Stars orbitting about the Galactic Center are probes of gravity
										and general relativity in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole.
										I study the kinemetics  of stellar masers (microwave lasers)
										in the inner parsec using observations from the VLA and ALMA.</p>

										<h4>Real-time Cosmology</h4>
										I started my graduate research studying proper motions of galaxies
										observed by Gaia, which are tracers of
									  cosmic expansion, large scale structure, primordial gravitational
									  waves, and more. Most recently, I developed methods to detect secular
									  extragalactic parallax in future Gaia data releases, which you can
									  read about in my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11935">latest paper</a>.</p>

							<h2>Outreach and Service</h2>
							<p>It is a great privilege to study astronomy professionally.
								I believe it is neccessary and personally rewarding to
								give back to the community through education and service.</p>
						</header>


							<h3>Public Outreach</h3>
							<p>My first outreach experiences were organizing "sidewalk astronomy"
								observing events as an officer in the Virgina Tech astronomy club.
								We brought telescopes to campus common areas late at night to educate unsuspecting
								college students.</br>

								As a graduate student, I especially enjoy the opportunities
								to interact with younger students who always impress me with their
								creativity and curiousity for science and astronomy.
								At the Sommers-Bausch Observatory annual Astronomy Day,
								I have educated elementary students on topics
								such as black holes and the EM spectrum. I have also volunteered
								at a Boulder elementary school to teach students about the history of astronomy
								and our evolving understanding of the cosmos.
								</p>

							<h3>Service</h3>
							<p>I am very proud to be a part of a department where graduate students
							have an active and influential role in committees.
							I have been elected to several committees, including
							graduate admissions, faculty hiring, comprehensive exams,
							and graduate cirriculum and concerns. My involvement on these committees
							and the tireless work of my peers has helped shape department policy and
							culture. </br>

							<section id="about">
								<header class="major">
								<h2>About me</h2>
							</header>

								<p>I am a doctoral candidate in the Astrophysics and Planetary Sciences Department
								at the University of Colorado Boulder. My graduate work with Prof. Jeremy
								Darling spans extragalactic astrophysics to the Galactic Center,
								with the common theme of studying the dynamic universe via proper motions.
							  My current focus is the kinematics of stellar SiO masers within the inner
								parsec of the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. </p>

								<p>Before coming to Boulder, I earned a B.S. in Physics from
									Virginia Tech in 2016. During my undergraduate studies, I worked
									with Dr. Sara Petty and Prof. Duncan Farrah studying hyperluminous
									infrared galaxies and quasars. In the summer of 2015, I had the
									opportunity to attend an NSF REU at the Harvard-Smithsonian
									Center for Astrophysics, where I worked with Drs. Georgiana
									Ogrean and Paul Nulsen studying the theromodynamic properties
									of the galaxy cluster Abell 133.</p>

								<p>I live in Boulder with my husband, Richard, an engineer who creates
									life-saving technology that keeps donor lungs alive before transplant.
									In my spare time, I enjoy reading with a cat in my lap, cooking,
									and practicing piano.</p>
