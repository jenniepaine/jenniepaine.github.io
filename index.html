                    <h4>Gravity in the Galactic Center</h4>
										<p> Stars orbitting about the Galactic Center are probes of gravity
										and general relativity in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole.
										I study the kinemetics  of stellar masers (microwave lasers)
										in the inner parsec using observations from the Very Large Array (VLA) and
										Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).
										You can read about these observations, the stellar kinematics,
										and their utility for constraining the mass distribution in the
									  Galactic Center in my
										<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..181P/abstract">latest paper</a>.</p>

										<h4>Real-time Cosmology</h4>
										I started my graduate research studying proper motions of galaxies
										observed by Gaia, which are tracers of
									  cosmic expansion, large scale structure, primordial gravitational
									  waves, and more. Most recently, I developed methods to detect secular
									  extragalactic parallax in future Gaia data releases.</p>

							<h2>Teaching and Service</h2>
							<p>It is a great privilege to study astronomy professionally.
								I believe it is neccessary and personally rewarding to
								give back to the community through education and service.</p>
						</header>
							<h3>Teaching</h3>
							<p>I was fortunate to have the opportunity to teach ASTR 1000 as
								instructor of record at University of Colorado during Summer 2020.
								I wrote the syllabus and developed class materials for remote learning.
								Since introductory astronomy courses are an excellent gateway to understanding
								the broader principles of science, I designed
								unit on scientific literacy for the primarily non-STEM major students
								taking the class.
								</p>

							<h3>Public Outreach</h3>
							<p>Sharing astronomy with the public is one of the most rewarding
								aspects of working in this field. I have engaged in outreach since
								undergrad, where I ran sidewalk astronomy events on my college's campus.</br>
								In Boulder, I have educated younger students on topics like black holes,
								the EM spectrum, and the history of astronomy through volunteering
								at the Sommers-Bausch Observatory and a local elementary school.
								</p>

							<h3>Service</h3>
							<p>I am very proud to be a part of a department where graduate students
							have an active and influential role in committees.
							I have been elected to several committees, including
							graduate admissions, faculty hiring, comprehensive exams,
							and graduate cirriculum and concerns. My involvement on these committees
							and the tireless work of my peers has helped shape department policy and
							culture. </br>

								<h2>About me</h2>
							</header>
							<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
								<span class="image right large" width=20%><img src="images/AAS2020_NSF.png" alt="NSF wall at AAS in Honolulu, HI, Jan. 2020" /></span>
								<p>I am a doctoral candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the
								Astrophysics and Planetary Sciences Department
								at the University of Colorado Boulder. My graduate work with Prof. Jeremy
								Darling spans extragalactic astrophysics to the Galactic Center,
								with the common theme of studying the dynamic universe via proper motions.
							  My current focus is the kinematics of stellar SiO masers within the inner
								parsec of the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. </p>
							</div>


								<p>Before coming to Boulder, I earned a B.S. in Physics from
									Virginia Tech in 2016. During my undergraduate studies, I worked
									with Dr. Sara Petty and Prof. Duncan Farrah studying hyperluminous
									infrared galaxies and quasars. In the summer of 2015, I had the
									opportunity to attend an NSF REU at the Harvard-Smithsonian
									Center for Astrophysics, where I worked with Drs. Georgiana
									Ogrean and Paul Nulsen studying the theromodynamic properties
									of the galaxy cluster Abell 133.</p>
