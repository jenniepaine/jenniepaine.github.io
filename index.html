					<p>I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and 
						NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, located in Greenbelt MD. 
						My current research is in cosmology using the Wide Field Instrument of the 
						upcoming <a href="https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov" target="_blank">Roman Space Telescope</a>.
						<br><br>
						I earned my Ph.D. in 2023 from the University of Colorado Boulder Department of Astrophysics and 
						Planetary Sciences, where I was an NSF Graduate Research Fellow. Before graduate school, I received
						my B.S. in Physics from Virginia Tech.

						<h2>Research</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						My research interests in cosmology include the growth of cosmic structure, 
						dark energy, and expansion. At NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, I work on
						projects related to the Wide Field Instrument of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will
						measure the growth and structure of the universe using multiple cosmological probes. 
						<br><br>
						Outside of Roman-related efforts, my research has broadly encompassed high precision measurements of astrophysical 
						motions as probes of cosmology and gravity. One area of interest for me is real-time cosmology
						using correlated proper motions of galaxies. Both cosmological and observer-induced effects 
						may create correlated proper motions, and much of my work has involved simulating these effects 
						and developing methods for cosmological measurements with proper motions using large astrometric 
						survey missions like <i>Gaia</i>. I have also been 
						using radio observations of SiO masers (microwave lasers in stellar atmospheres) to trace
						the motions of stars in orbit around a few parsecs from the Galactic Center. Since this region
						is affected by dust obscuration and crowding, masers observed in radio are unique, high resolution
						tracers of the gravitational profile.

								<h3>3D Kinematics of Stellar SiO Masers in the Galactic Center</h3>
								<p>In this paper, I measured high precision 3D velocities and acceleration
									constraints of stellar masers (microwave lasers)
									in the inner several parsec of the Galactic Center using over two decades of 
									observations from the Very Large Array (VLA) and
									Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). These masers are unique probes
									of the gravitational profile in a region of the Galaxy that is 
									highly affected by stellar crowding and dust obscuration at shorter wavelengths, and
									where there is much uncertainty about the distribution of dark matter. 
									We found that the kinematics were generally in line with expectations for stars in orbit
									about the Galactic Center. Notably, there are several stars with anomalously large velocities
									or accelerations, requiring further observations to constrain the systemic stellar motion as 
									opposed to inherent noise of the maser source.<br>

								<h3>Secular Extragalactic Parallax: Measurement Methods and Predictions for Gaia</h3>
								<p>This paper explores the prospects of measuring the motion of the solar system with 
									respect to an extragalactic rest frame using dipolar correlated proper motions of galaxies, a signal
									known as secular parallax due to the distance dependence of the amplitude of the signal. A statistical 
									detection of the secular parallax amplitude as a function of distance
									could be used to constrain the local Hubble parameter. 
									We selected nearby galaxies detected by the <i>Gaia</i> astrometric mission with
									redshift independent distance measurements from <i>Cosmicflows-3</i>, and measured
									an upper limit on the secular parallax dipole in <i>Gaia</i> Data Release 2. 
									We also simulated the secular parallax signal that will be detectable by <i>Gaia</i>'s 
									end of mission. We found that while peculiar proper motions of galaxies due to gravitational
									interactions with large-scale overdensities
									offset the total dipole signal, one may recover secular parallax using the CMB dipole direction
									as a prior on the direction of motion.

								<h3>The Gaia-WISE Extragalactic Astrometric Catalog</h3>
								<p>This work was about identifying AGN detected by <i>Gaia</i> and forecasting the sensitivity 
									of their proper motions for detecting low-multipole correlated motions. We identified >500,000
									AGN in the first <i>Gaia</i> data release using <i>WISE</i> two-color criteria, and found that 
									the catalog has very low (0.2%) stellar contamination, an important metric due to the relatively large 
									proper motions of stars in our galaxy. By simulating the end-of-mission proper motions of the catalog,
									we found that <i>Gaia</i> proper motions will constrain the isotropy of the Hubble expansion to about 2%.
									This catalog was also used for a prediction of a <i>Gaia</i> astrometry-based limit on the stochastic gravitational wave 
									background <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...861..113D/abstract"

						<h2>Teaching and Service</h2>
					</header>
						<p>It is a great privilege to study astronomy professionally, so 
							I believe it is neccessary and personally to engage with the community through education and service. 
							These are some highlights of my teaching, outreach, and service experiences.
						</p>

						<h3>Teaching</h3>
							<p>I was the instructor for ASTR 1000, an introductory astronomy course, at CU Boulder during Summer 2020.
								I wrote the syllabus and developed class materials for remote learning.
								Since astronomy courses are an excellent gateway to understanding
								the broader principles of science, I designed a
								unit on scientific literacy for the primarily non-STEM major students
								taking the class. <br>
								In 2019, I participated in the <a href="https://isee.ucsc.edu/programs/pdp/" target="_blank">ISEE Professional Development Program (PDP)</a>, 
								which is an intensive program on inclusive education and professional development training. 
								With my PDP team, I designed and taught an 
								inquiry-based workshop on buoyancy in nature for incoming freshmen at CU Boulder. <br>
								I have also engaged in public outreach and education since
								undergrad, where I ran sidewalk astronomy events on my college's campus.
								In Boulder, I educated younger learners on topics like black holes,
								the EM spectrum, and the history of astronomy through volunteering
								at the Sommers-Bausch Observatory and at a local elementary school.
								</p>

						<h3>Service</h3>
						<p>Since 2022, I have been a member of the 
							<a href="https://info.nrao.edu/do/committees" target="_blank">NRAO/GBO Users Committee</a>,
							charged with advising NRAO and GBO on matters affecting users of the observatories. 
							As a grad student, I was elected to several committees in the Astrophysics
							and Planetary Sciences Department, including graduate admissions, faculty hiring, 
							comprehensive exams, and graduate cirriculum and concerns. One of the most rewarding 
							outcomes of my committee service at CU was contributing to the design of new 
							annual progress reviews for PhD candidates and pushing for a structure that 
							would be supportive and productive for students.
